{"Un rivale di Sherlock Holmes (1907)": "One of the world's earliest \"Sherlock\" films (according to David S Davies' book, \"Holmes of the Movies\" (1968), and now lost. It was preceded by, and soon followed by, films from the US, Denmark, Germany, England, France, and other lands, many of them made without permission from author A C Doyle and his representatives. Apparently some of these early borrowers got around Doyle's copyrights by claiming the characters were not Doyle's own creations but merely admirers of them, as in this Italian \"spin-off\" from 1907. When \"Rival of Sherlock\" was imported to the US in 1908, it was reviewed by \"Moving Picture World\" (quoted by Davies), crediting the detective-hero (Sherlock's \"rival\") as using several disguises as he tracks down the crooks amidst some action-filled confrontations. As with many other film primitives made that early, \"Rival of Sherlock\" unfortunately lacks individual credits (director, star, producer, etc.), even in Aldo Bernardini's huge catalog of Italian silent films (\"Archivio del cinema italiano,\" v. 1, 1991). Incidentally, the US distributor of this film seems to have mistranslated its title as \"Rival Sherlock Holmes\" [sic] -- the incomplete title then passed on by \"Moving Picture World\" and by Davies."}

The first guest who arrived after Sally's decision was plainly a suspicious character. To begin with, he was quietly dressed and perfectly respectable in appearance. So Sally 'shadowed the stranger in the most approved fashion. When he locked the door to his room she looked over the transom. Sure enough he took some jewels out of his suitcase. Sally instantly summoned the police. Entering the room to keep the man under closer surveillance, she accidentally pointed a fan, shaped like a pistol at him. Instantly his hands shot above his head.
